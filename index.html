                During the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to teach English at 
                Xinyi Middle School in Taipei. After a week-long training session focused on
                effective communication and teamwork, I spent two weeks with middle school
                students, helping them build critical language skills.

                and equipment to delivering meals to patients.
